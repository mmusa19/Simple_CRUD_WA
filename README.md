Simple CRUD App (MySQL, Node, React)

** client-side on branch main **

** server-side on branch server-side **



Simple CRUD app (React, Node, MySQL) There is a simple CRUD app. App has a full-stack functionality with vertical from MySQL Database, backend with Node.js (framework Express), and front-end JS framework React.js. Just as I said, this app is a basic view of understanding full-stack flow. Many improvements are possible here (Router for React, validation on the client-side and better for server-side, better UI, textarea instead of review input, and more...) I created simple Authentication, with a crucial route in backend (register, login, logout), and also here are many improvements possibility. The app can easily be deployed (on HEROKU probably), and a source code is here on GitHub ... To fully access the app, you need to clone the GitHub repository and install npm or yarn for the client-side and run with ( npm run start ) command for the server-side nodemon package install. This package offers you a change on the app without restarting the server (for run npm run devServer), and you need to connect your MySQL database with node on the correct path ...
